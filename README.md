# gps_test

A flutter project to test localization
w
[[_TOC_]]

## ðŸ¤” What I did?
Following principles of clean arch (but not enought), I tried to create clients and service to encapsulate the used library. When users not authorize, then it shows error message according the user action, like permission denied or denied forever.

I used [geolocator](https://pub.dev/packages/geolocator) package to get location.

## Application running
